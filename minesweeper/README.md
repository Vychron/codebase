Minesweeper

By Demi Azela (formerly known as Mike Damion) Joseph,
Game Development class GD3B at Mediacollege Amsterdam.

This Folder contains the code I wrote to recreate the classic game Minesweeper.

---Description---
###### The game consists of a minefield, a restart button (smiley), a timer and a counter.<br>The minefield consists of tiles containing mines, and empty tiles, often numbered to indicate the amount of adjecent mine tiles.<br>The counter (3 numbers on the left) keeps track of how many mines you still need to dismantle (given that you placed your flags on top op mines).<br>The timer (3 numbers on the right) keeps track of how long you have been playing (in seconds).<br>You can explore the minefield by clicking on a tile, but if you click on a tile that hides a mine, you lose.<br>You can mark a mine (place a flag on top) by right-clicking on a tile, and remove the placed flags by right-clicking on them a second time.<br>You win if all the mines are marked with a flag, and no other tiles have flags on them.<br>You can restart the game at any moment by clicking on the button with the smiley.<br>
